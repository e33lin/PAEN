        Tickets are where you can highlight any highlights or indifferences you have with teammates.
        <br>
        Every week you will only be able to submit one ticket per user, but you can also group users in a single ticket.
    </p>
    <h3 style="text-align:left">What if I only want to focus on a single trait or question?</h3>
    <p style="margin-left:10px; margin-right:5%;">
        No problem!ðŸ˜„ For every ticket you can select the "typical" option from the drop-down and this essentially is treated as neutral.
        <br>
        This allows you to focus solely on the topic or question you want to highlight. So have at it!
    </p>
    <h3 style="text-align:left">What does the overall rating mean?</h3>
     <p style="margin-left:10px; margin-right:5%;">
       Overall ratings are exactly what they sound like.
       <br>
       You can think of the ratings as follows:
     </p>
    <p style="margin-left:30px; margin-right:5%;">
