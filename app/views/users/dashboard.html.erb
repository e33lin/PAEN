    <h3>Teams:</h3>
    <p style="margin-left:10px; margin-right:5%;">
        Teams are where you can view all of the teams you are on!
        <br>
        <br>
        The displayed table shows you all of your teams, their weekly health, the status of the survey completions, and a link to create a ticket for that team.
        <br>
        By the way, you can find out more about who is on your team by clicking on the team name.
        <br><br>
        <b>What if I'm not on any teams yet?😲</b>
        <br>
        No problem! Hopefully your manager will add you to a team. If you aren't on a team yet, and you are not expecting to be on a team, then you have nothing to worry about
    </p>
    <h3>Weekly Survey Information:</h3>
    <p style="margin-left:10px; margin-right:5%;">
        The weekly survey information is where you will be reflecting about your past week!🙌🙌🙌
        <br><br>
        <b>How does this work?</b>
        <br>
        Every week, you will be able to respond to questions with an number between 1-5.
        <br>
        Additionally, if there are any personal issues with another team member, you can create a ticket about the teammate(s) you have issues with and this will be reflected to your manager and the team health.
        <br><br>
        <b>What do these ratings mean?</b>
        <br>
        Generally, we like to think these ratings as follows:
        <br>
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left:30px">
        1: 😭 - Absolutely terrible
        <br>
        2: 😟 - It could be better
        <br>
        3: 😐 - Meh, could be better could be worse.
        <br>
        4: 🙂 - Hey, this is pretty good
        <br>
        5: 🥳 - Loved it; 10/10 would do that again
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left:10px; margin-right:5%;">
        <b>What is the Weekly Survey Due Date?</b>
        <br>
        The weekly survey due date is, well, the deadline for you to submit that week's survey.
        <br>
        Every week you will be able to complete a new survey for that week.
        <br><br>
        <b>Cool! But what is the point of the surveys?</b>
        <br>
        We are so happy you asked!
        <br>
        We make sure to record all of the ratings your teammates input every week. This data is then processed by a super secret algorithm our programming wizards created!🧙 After the algorithm has chewed on the ratings, it spits out a value representing your team's health!
        <br><br>
        <b>Yeah and?</b>
        <br>
        Now this is the cool part! Your team health is an overall reflection of your individual team member's feelings about work as well as highlight any inter-personal team issues within your team. The best part? You get to see all of this from one website!
