    <p style="margin-left:10px; margin-right:5%;">
        Welcome to your dashboard! Here you can view all of the teams you manage!
        <br>
        <br>
        The table displayed above shows you all of your teams, their weekly health, and the number of students in the team who have completed this week's survey. 
        <br>
        You can find out more about what weekly health means by clicking on any of your teams and using the 'Confused? Get information here!' link below!
        <br><br>
        <b>What if I don't have any teams yet?😲</b>
        <br>
        No problem! You can easily create a new team and start monitoring that team's health by clicking the "New Team" link found under the My Teams table. Happy team building!

    <h3>Weekly Survey Information:</h3>
    <p style="margin-left:10px; margin-right:5%;">
        The weekly survey information is where we display the questions that your amazing team members will be answering this week!🙌🙌🙌
        <br><br>
        <b>How does this work?</b>
        <br>
        Every week, your team members will be able to respond to the displayed questions.
        <br>
        Please note, that if there are any personal issues between members, either member can create a ticket. For more information on tickets, click the 'View All Tickets' link at the bottom of your dashboard and then use the 'Confused? Get information here!' link below!
        <br><br>
        <b>What do these ratings mean?</b>
        <br>
        Generally, we like to think of these ratings as follows:
        <br>
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left:30px">
        1: 😭 - Absolutely terrible
        <br>
        2: 😟 - It could be better
        <br>
        3: 😐 - Meh, could be better could be worse.
        <br>
        4: 🙂 - Hey, this is pretty good
        <br>
        5: 🥳 - Loved it; 10/10 would do that again
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left:10px; margin-right:5%;">
        <b>What is the Weekly Survey Due Date?</b>
        <br>
        The weekly survey due date is, well, the deadline for your team members to submit the current week's survey.
        <br>
        Each week the team will be able to complete a new survey for that week.
        <br><br>
        <b>Cool! But what is the point of the surveys?</b>
        <br>
        We are so happy you asked!
        <br>
        We make sure to record all of the ratings your team members input every week. This data is then processed by a super secret algorithm our programming wizards created!🧙 After the algorithm has chewed on the ratings, it spits out a value representing your team's health!
        <br><br>
        <b>Yeah and?</b>
        <br>
        Now this is the cool part! Your team health is an overall reflection of your team members' feelings about work as well as any inter-personal team health issues. The best part? You get to see all of this in one website!
        <br><br>

    <h3>What if I want more information about my team?</h3>
