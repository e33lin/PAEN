        Welcome to your dashboard! Here you can view all of the teams you manage!
        <br>
        <br>
        The table displayed above shows you all of your teams, their weekly health, and the number of students in the team who have completed this week's survey. 
        You can click on the view tickets link for each team to see a list of tickets team members submitted for the current week.
        <br>
        To find out more about what weekly health means, click on any of your teams and using the 'Confused? Get information here!' link!
        You can also find out more about tickets by clicking the view tickets link. 
        <br><br>
        <b>What if I don't have any teams yet?😲</b>
        <br>
        No problem! You can easily create a new team and start monitoring that team's health by clicking the "New Team" link found under the My Teams table. 
        However, note that students must create an account first before you can add them to a team. Happy team building!

    <h3 style="text-align:left">Weekly Survey Information:</h3>
    <p style="margin-left:10px; margin-right:5%;">
        The weekly survey information is where we display the questions that your amazing team members will be answering this week!🙌🙌🙌
        <br><br>
        <b>How does this work?</b>
        <br>
        Every week, your team members will be able to respond to the displayed questions.
        <br>
        Please note, that if there are any personal issues between members, either member can create a ticket. For more information on tickets, click the 'View All Tickets' link at the bottom of your dashboard and then use the 'Confused? Get information here!' link below!
        <br><br>
        <b>What do these ratings mean?</b>
        <br>
        Generally, we like to think of these ratings as follows:
        <br>
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left:30px">
        1: 😭 - Absolutely terrible
        <br>
        2: 😟 - It could be better
        <br>
        3: 😐 - Meh, could be better could be worse.
        <br>
        4: 🙂 - Hey, this is pretty good
        <br>
        5: 🥳 - Loved it; 10/10 would do that again
    </p>
    <br>
    <p style="margin-left:10px; margin-right:5%;">
        <b>What is the Weekly Survey Due Date?</b>
        <br>
        The weekly survey due date is, well, the deadline for your team members to submit the current week's survey.
        <br>
        Each week the team will be able to complete a new survey for that week. 
        <br>
        The due date is displayed in UTC to accomodate for the fact that team members may be in different timezones. 
        <br><br>
        <b>Cool! But what is the point of the surveys?</b>
        <br>
        We are so happy you asked!
        <br>
        We make sure to record all of the ratings your team members input every week. This data is then processed by a super secret algorithm our programming wizards created!🧙 After the algorithm has chewed on the ratings, it spits out a value representing your team's health!
        <br><br>
        <b>Yeah and?</b>
        <br>
        Now this is the cool part! Your team health is an overall reflection of your team members' feelings about work as well as any inter-personal team health issues. The best part? You get to see all of this in one website!
        <br><br>
    </p>
    <h3 style="text-align:left">What if I want more information about my team?</h3>
    <p style="margin-left:10px; margin-right:5%;">
        If you want to see more detailed information about a certain team's health or you want to edit a team simply click on that team's name and check out everything there is to know about your team!
