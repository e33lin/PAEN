<h3>Weekly Survey Information:</h3>
<p style="margin-left:10px; margin-right:5%;">
    The weekly survey information is where we show off all the questions that your amazing team members will be answering this week!🙌🙌🙌
    <br><br>
    <b>How does this work?</b>
    <br>
    Every week, your team members will be able to respond to these questions with an number between 1-5.
    <br>
    Additionally, if there are any personal issues with another team member, that team member could create a ticket about the teammate they have issues with and their rating will be counted for that week's survey.
    <br><br>
    <b>What do these ratings mean?</b>
    <br>
    Generally, we like to think these ratings as follows:
    <br>
</p>
<p style="margin-left:30px">
    1: 😭 - Absolutely terrible
    <br>
    2: 😟 - It could be better
    <br>
    3: 😐 - Meh, could be better could be worse.
    <br>
    4: 🙂 - Hey, this is pretty good
    <br>
    5: 🥳 - Loved it; 10/10 would do that again
</p>
<p style="margin-left:10px; margin-right:5%;">
    <b>What is the Weekly Survey Due Date?</b>
    <br>
    The weekly survey due date is, well, the deadline for your team members to submit that week's survey.
    <br>
    Every week the team will be able to complete a new survey for that week.
    <br><br>
    <b>Cool! But what is the point of the surveys?</b>
    <br>
    We are so happy you asked!
    <br>
    We make sure to record all of the ratings your team members input every week. This data is then processed by a super secret algorithm our programming wizards created!🧙 After the algorithm has chewed on the ratings, it spits out a value representing your team's health!
    <br><br>
    <b>Yeah and?</b>
    <br>
    Now this is the cool part! Your team health is an overall reflection of your individual team member's feelings about work as well as highlight any inter-personal team issues within your team. The best part? You get to see all of this from one website!
    <br><br>
